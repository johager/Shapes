# Shapes

This is the Devmountain iOS App Developer Bootcamp exercise Build Your Own App - Protocol & Delegate app.

The app presents eight shapes in a UICollectionView, and the shape's properties can be changed on a modal view.

The modal view communicates with the ModelController through a protocol/delegate pattern.
